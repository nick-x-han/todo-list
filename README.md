# To-Do List
The purpose of this project is to practice OOP principles such as SOLID, as well as with objects in general. 

The to-do list has a default "project" to which tasks will be appended. Users can create new projects and then choose which project a todo will go into.

Data will be stored on the user's computer with localStorage.
